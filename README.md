### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the github page of âš¡ _SuperElectron_ âš¡


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently as a sofware consultant, but <ins>looking for a new journey</ins> after some time travelling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about AI, and specifically about toolkits used in machine learning.  


### Check out some of my code

âœ¨ _detection-opencv-pytorch_ âœ¨ [repo](https://github.com/SuperElectron/detection-opencv-pytorch)

This repository implements object detection using PyTorch and utilizes OpenCV for camera input. It provides a simple, practical example of integrating deep learning models with real-time video streams and sending the messages via kafka to a cloud server.


âœ¨ _Deepstream-3D-Depth-Camera_ âœ¨ [repo](https://github.com/SuperElectron/deepstream-3d-depth-camera)

Demonstrating the capabilities of the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK with 3D cameras, this repository showcases the capture of depth and color images from a RealSense camera (DS435). The data is then processed through a DeepStream pipeline for further analysis and has two default options (2d or 3D point cloud) for down stream processing.

âœ¨ _TensorRT C++ Samples_ âœ¨ [repo](https://github.com/SuperElectron/TensorRT-samples)

Here we have a playground with references to the TensorRT API for accelerated inference on Nvidia GPUs.

âœ¨ _Home Surveillance_ âœ¨ [repo](https://github.com/SuperElectron/home-surveillance)

Simple yet effective, this repository is a homemade surveillance system that operates on a Nvidia Jetson to stream IP cameras. Features include video display, video backup with AWS S3, and device monitoring via elastic stack (logstash, elasticsearch, granfana) with alerting on device health.

âœ¨ _Kubernetes Stack_ âœ¨ [repo](https://github.com/SuperElectron/kubernetes-stack)

This is a simple template to demonstrate how kubernetes can manage a fleet of edge devices and servers within a restricted service domain.
